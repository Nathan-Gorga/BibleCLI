# BibleCLI
A tool in C to read, study and learn the Bible all in CLI

## Ideas
- the program is a binary that can be set as a command.
- it can be called using something like "bible 'args' "
- the program prints in the cli a bible passage.
- the program can be used in 2 ways, spontaneous and session.
- spontaneous is used as such "bible john 1:1" and it will print John chapter 1 verse 1
- session mode can be entered with "bible session", during this mode you can browse the bible, add notes, compare passages, use AI voice to narrate it to you.
- to call on a book you can use either the full name (mark) or the diminutive (mk)
- the actual text is requested from a reliable API
- the translation can be specified in config or by specifying a flag
- you can add notes to a passage, chapter or book which are stored locally and summoned if wanted when calling back on the same passage
- you can call on to multiple different passages
- AI voice is used to narrate, a cool feature could be to have different voices depending on the books
- you can call onto the original text in greek and hebrew
- you can find using a grep like tool a phrase in the bible if you don't remember the chapter and verse
- you can download the bible to work in offline mode
- you can turn on commentary an footnotes
- it is possible to add links between passages to show correlation, typography or continuation of philosophical and theological arguments
- save certain passages in a "memorize playlist". you can then access them in an Anki style to memorize them
- you can add tags to verses to identify them as part of a same theme (divinity of Jesus, prophecy, trinity, life of jesus, etc.)
